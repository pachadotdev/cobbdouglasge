The goal of cobbdouglasge is to show how to plot the solutions of a 2x2 Cobb-Douglas general equilibrium model in R using Shiny.

To run the app locally, clone the repository https://github.com/pachadotdev/cobbdouglasge and then from RStudio/VSCode run the following in the R console:

```r
devtools::load_all()
run_app()
```

The base for this demonstration was exercise 15.B.2 from MWG.

I hope this is useful!
